                <h2>Everything music</h2><br>
                <p>Music has brought me peace and joy on countless occassions and it keeps doing so. My musical tastes are broad and includes lots of genres, from western classical to electronic ambient, from blues to bollywood music, and from... you get the idea. All types of music is art, although there are some genres that I don't listen to, but maybe that is also an art which I don't quite understand. Well, some people even see modern art of Picasso and claim that their 8 year old niece could have also drawn that. I am not some critic, only a music lover(and a creator on some occassions hehe). Below I have linked my personal Spotify account where you can find playlists of some of the music I hear and some are even separated by genres, you can have a listen and maybe you will find yourself some great music you like. Next I have my SoundCloud link where I have uploaded some of my originals. I am working on some songs right now as well which will hopefully see light of the day if I release/distribute them. Finally you can connect with me on Instagram where I post covers sometimes. Hit me up!</p>
